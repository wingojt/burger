# Burger Eating Simulator 2018
Made with Node, Express, MySQL and Handlebars
Deployed on Heroku

## How it works
Users can select which burger they would like to consume.
The simulation then changes the state of that burger from "not eaten" to "eaten".
The user is filled with a sense of accomplishment as they consume the selection of burgers before them.

## Additional features
The user can also add as many burgers as they would like, due to the immense power of the simulation. 
The only limitation is the users imagination!
